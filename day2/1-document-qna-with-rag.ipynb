If you are having any issues, please [check out the troubleshooting steps there](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-1-prompting#Get-started-with-Kaggle-notebooks).\n\nTwo big limitations of LLMs are 1) that they only \"know\" the information that they were trained on, and 2) that they have limited input context windows. A way to address both of these limitations is to use a technique called Retrieval Augmented Generation, or RAG. A RAG system has three stages:\n\n1. Indexing\n2. Retrieval\n3. Generation\n\nIndexing happens ahead of time, and allows you to quickly look up relevant information at query-time. When a query comes in, you retrieve relevant documents, combine them with your instructions and the user's query, and have the LLM generate a tailored answer in natural language using the supplied information. This allows you to provide information that the model hasn't seen before, such as product-specific knowledge or live weather updates.\n\nIn this notebook you will use the Gemini API to create a vector database, retrieve answers to questions from the database and generate a final answer. You will use [Chroma](https://docs.trychroma.com/), an open-source vector database. With Chroma, you can store embeddings alongside metadata, embed documents and queries, and search your documents.\n\n## For help\n\n**Common issues are covered in the [FAQ and troubleshooting guide](https://www.kaggle.com/code/markishere/day-0-troubleshooting-and-faqs).**\n","metadata":{"id":"CsVPnR8VbXE6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"## Setup\n\nFirst, install ChromaDB and the Gemini API Python SDK.","metadata":{"id":"akuOzK4dJl3j"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":"%pip install -U -q \"google-generativeai>=0.8.3\" chromadb","metadata":{"id":"JbXe7Oodc5dP","trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2024-11-24T11:27:51.912415Z","iopub.execute_input":"2024-11-24T11:27:51.912833Z","iopub.status.idle":"2024-11-24T11:28:03.680035Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2024-11-24T11:27:51.912796Z","shell.execute_reply":"2024-11-24T11:28:03.678636Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","text":"Note: you may need to restart the kernel to use updated packages.\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":1},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"You may see output containing `ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed` - this is OK, the packages are still installed and compatible for this codelab.
